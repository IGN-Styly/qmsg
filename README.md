simple messaging for everything and everyone.

This Cargo workspace contains:

| `crates/qmsg-types` | `qmsg_types` library | Types shared by the orchestrator and providers |
| `providers/echo` | `.wasm` component | Example provider |

## Providers

A provider connects qmsg to one messaging platform. Providers are Rust crates
built against `qmsg-sdk` and compiled to `wasm32-wasip2` components. Each
provider owns its network connections and has full TCP and UDP access.

Each provider runs on its own thread and talks to the orchestrator over a
WebSocket on localhost, sending postcard-encoded `qmsg-types` messages.
`wit/qmsg.wit` only exports the entry point and should not need to change.
Change the types instead. New enum variants go at the end; any other change,
including adding a field, needs an `ABI_VERSION` bump, because postcard can't
decode a layout it doesn't know.

Providers report the organizations they are part of, such as Discord servers
or Slack workspaces, with `Context::directory`. An organization holds users
and channels. Channels can also stand alone, outside any organization, for
direct and group messages. Each channel has a kind (text, voice, video, announcement, forum,
direct, group, or a custom one) and lists the content it accepts as inputs.
Message content is a list of parts, so one message can carry text, images,
video, audio, files and custom content together. A provider sends a whole
organization when it joins, then updates single users and channels as they
change. The orchestrator passes these on as `ProviderEvent::Directory`, and
`Directory` keeps the current state of each provider's organizations and
channels.

Providers keep secrets, such as tokens, with `secret_get`, `secret_set` and
`secret_delete` in the SDK. The orchestrator stores them in SQLite at
`<data_dir>/qmsg.db` and encrypts them with XChaCha20-Poly1305 under a master
key held in the OS keychain: Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows
and Secret Service on Linux. Each data directory has its own key, and only one
orchestrator can use a data directory at a time. Without a keychain, secrets
are stored as plain text. `data_dir` defaults to `~/.qmsg`; the example config
sets it to `.qmsg` in the current directory.

The example provider connects to a line-based TCP server, so start one first.
Type a line into it to send the provider its greeting:

```sh
nc -lk 127.0.0.1 7000
```

Then build the provider and run the orchestrator:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
cargo build -p qmsg-provider-echo --target wasm32-wasip2
cp orchestrator.example.toml orchestrator.toml
cargo run --bin qmsg-orchestrator
```

## Development

Run the main app:

```sh
cargo run --bin qmsg
```

Build or test all crates:

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
```

The orchestrator's tests build the echo provider themselves, so they need the
`wasm32-wasip2` target installed.
